I am a Software Engineer at [Redpanda Data](https://redpanda.com). My work revolves around the reproducible evaluation of distributed storage, data management and real-time analytics systems. My [2019 PhD dissertation](https://escholarship.org/content/qt8206n6nz/qt8206n6nz_noSplash_aa992709bea701c3a9d687cb2d229e50.pdf) focused on applying the DevOps methodology on R&D and academic settings.
